Supplementary Material Description

The supplementary materials provided include the following components:

1. classification.csv
   This CSV file contains the parameter combinations used in the study. The category of each parameter set is provided under the column "classification", while the corresponding eigenvalue type is listed under the column "Eigen_TAG".

2. Multistability Plots
   - The folder "MultistabilityCompressedResults" contains supplementary multistability plots.
   - Multistability1.pdf and Multistability3.pdf contain multistability plots generated from various initial state combinations.
   - To access additional plots, extract the compressed file "Multistability2.zip" located within this folder.

3. Attractor Plots
   - The folder "AttractorCompressedResults" includes selected attractor plots from the non-divergent group.
   - To access the full attractor plots, extract the compressed file "Attractors.zip" located within this folder.

Note: Compressed files have been split into multiple parts to avoid large single-file uploads.
